This was an extremely favourable moment for the birth of an organization because of the numerous foreign scholars already present in Rome during the war, and those who would reach it in the footsteps of the allied troops.\n\nIdeally the history of AIAC began in 1823, when four Nordic intellectuals, A. Kestner, O. Magnus von Stackelberg, E. Gerhard and Th. Panofka, met together to read the classics and explore the antiquities of Rome and its neighbourhood, founding the \'Circle of Hyperborean Romans\', named for a mythical people found at the edges of the inhabited world.  Within this friendly society, animated by dilettantes and amateurs but inspired by serious scientific interests, there quickly grew a need for a greater diffusion of information about archaeological discoveries.'
