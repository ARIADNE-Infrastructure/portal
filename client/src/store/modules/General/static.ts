All data sets are described with very detailed metadata according to the newly developed international dendrochronological data standard TRiDaS (Jansma et al. 2010). The collection is derived by research from archaeological sites (including old landscapes), shipwrecks, historical architecture and mobile heritage (e.g. paintings, furniture). Since 2015, it was possible for others to create their own dendrochronological archive: <a href=\"https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dccd-webui\">GitHub - DANS-KNAW/dccd-webui: DCCD Web-UI</a>.

The tool is intended for vocabularies already expressed in RDF/SKOS and can work directly with the data – querying external SPARQL endpoints rather than storing any local copies of complete vocabularies. The set of mappings developed can be saved locally, reloaded and exported to a number of different output formats.

A set of interactive controls offer search and browsing of the extracted archaeological data. The controls are designed to be browser agnostic and the Demonstrator will run in most modern browsers. The experimental Web application cross searches over information extracted from datasets and text reports and expressed as CRM/AAT based RDF. Information from Dutch, English, Swedish archaeological reports was extracted by Natural Language Processing pipelines.
